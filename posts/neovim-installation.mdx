# A Brief Guide on Installing Neovim on WSL 2

There were lots of hurdles I had to hop over when I tried to install Neovim on my WSL 2 environment, so I wrote down a simple guide to look back on. Please note I'm using the Ubuntu distribution, so some of the commands may differ. In any case, let's get started:

1. Installed prerequisites: `sudo apt-get install ninja-build gettext cmake unzip curl build-essential`
2. Navigate to my `~/repos` folder and clone the neovim repository here: `cd ~/repos && git clone https://github.com/neovim/neovim`
3. Ran `cd ~/repos/neovim` and checked out the stable branch with `git checkout stable`
4. I wanted Neovim installed in a specific directory, namely in my own `~/src` directory. Why? I guess simply to keep things organized. The official neovim repo said installing in the default `/usr/local` directory can [complicate](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/INSTALL.md#install-from-source) uninstallation. In any case, we have to build it first by running the following command with some cmake flags:

`make CMAKE_EXTRA_FLAGS="-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/src/neovim" CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo`

(Note you can change the build type here, I went with RelWithDebInfo, best of both worlds.)

5. Run the installation with `make install`
6. Add this line to your .bashrc file: `export PATH="$HOME/src/neovim/bin:$PATH"`
   and run `source .bashrc` to make the changes permanent.

Check everything is working by running `nvim --version`. Your output should look something like:

```
NVIM v0.10.0
Build type: RelWithDebInfo
LuaJIT 2.1.1713484068
Run "nvim -V1 -v" for more info
```

Now to get started with configuring Neovim to your liking, you should first create the config directory with `mkdir -p ~/.config/nvim`. From here you can write your own config with the `init.lua` starting point lua module, or clone other configs or distributions found on Github. Here's [mine](https://github.com/isai7710/darksaber-nvim) if you want to take a look at it.

### Another quick note on Lua and Luarocks

Since I'm using [lazy.nvim](https://www.lazyvim.org/), one of the requirements is to have luarocks installed.
