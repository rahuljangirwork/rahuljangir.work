# My First Linux Setup 🐧

Switching to Linux felt like stepping into a developer’s playground.

This post outlines how I customized my Linux desktop for development and productivity, while keeping everything lightweight and clean.

## 💻 OS and Window Manager

- **Base**: Debian 12 (NetInstall)
- **WM**: i3 → then moved to DWM
- **Display Manager**: LightDM
- **Terminal**: Alacritty
- **Shell**: Zsh with Oh-My-Zsh

> I avoided bloated desktop environments and went minimal from the start.
