## Hi.

This derivation was one of my favorites during my undergrad, and was one of the first derivations I actually followed along in the textbooks. Scroll down a bit for a basic animation of what we'll be deriving. Thanks and let me know about any thoughts or concerns you may have.

## First Steps

As with any engineering problem, we have to start off small and make some assumptions. Take a look at the following primsatic beam under **pure bending** conditions:

Let's assume the following
